# Winful fish restaurant Automation Solution

## Background
Winful fish restaurant is a family-owned business with over a decade of experience in the seafood industry. The company heavily relies on QuickBooks for essential tasks such as invoicing, stocking, and accounting. However, manual processes have led to frequent errors in daily operations, prompting the need for an automated solution.

## Challenges
- Lack of a defined and automated process from order-taking to packaging, resulting in a notable number of human errors.
- Absence of a digital product catalog, limiting customer engagement and sales opportunities.

## Solution
To address these challenges, we have developed a Node.js application integrated with Twilio for real-time inventory tracking and order processing. The solution allows sales, warehouse, and admin personnel to use their smartphones to interact with a WhatsApp chatbot, enabling seamless communication and access to inventory information and reports.

## Benefits of WhatsApp Integration
- **Platform Portability**: WhatsApp is available on various platforms, ensuring accessibility for users regardless of their device.
- **No UI/UX Design Needed**: Utilizing WhatsApp's existing interface eliminates the need for additional design efforts, saving time and resources.
- **Low Cost**: Integrating WhatsApp is cost-effective, with affordable pricing plans for WhatsApp Business API and free usage for personal or small-scale business purposes.
- **Flexibility**: Leveraging WhatsApp's features such as text messaging, image sharing, and group chats offers flexibility in communication within the application.
- **Availability**: WhatsApp has a large user base worldwide, making it an accessible communication channel for your application's users.
