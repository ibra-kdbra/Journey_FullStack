## Introduction
This sample demonstrates how one can

- Setup base architecture of React Native app using Clean Architecture
- Use dependency injection for layers separation
- Make api calls using Axios plugin.

# Module Structure

<p align="center">
  <img src="" />
</p>

There are 3 main modules to help separate the code. They are Data, Domain, and Presentaion.

- **Data** contains Local Storage, APIs, Data objects (Request/Response object, DB objects), and the repository implementation.

- **Domain** contains UseCases, Domain Objects/Models, and Repository Interfaces

- **Presentaion** contains UI, View Objects, Widgets, etc. Can be split into separate modules itself if needed. For example, we could have a module called Device handling things like camera, location, etc.


# Package structure
- Using modular architecture to architect the app per feature to be easier and more readable and isolate the feature from each other

# Repository
- Bridge between Data layer and Domain layer
- Connects to data sources and returns mapped data
- Data sources include DB and Api

# UseCase
- Responsible for connecting to repository to retrieve necessary data. returns a Stream that will emit each update.
- This is where the business logic takes place.
- Returns data downstream.
- Single use.
- Lives in Domain (No Platform dependencies. Very testable).

# Presentation (Holder)
- Organizes data and holds View state.
- Talks to use cases.

# Presentation (View)
- View,updates UI
