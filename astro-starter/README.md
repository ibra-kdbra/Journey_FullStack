## 🎨 Tech Stack

-   [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) - Static Site Generator
-   [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) - Component-Based UI
-   [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-First Styling

-   [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type Safety & Enhanced DX

## 🗂️ Project Structure

To maintain clarity and scalability, we organize the project using a **libs system**. This ensures reusability and a modular architecture.

```
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/           # Base layouts such as the **MainLayout** and **SEO meta configurations**.
│   ├── libs/
│   │   ├── ui/             # All components, blocks, modules - whole structure of the reusable elements that you can use in your project.
│   ├── pages/             # Astro pages (each file maps to a route)
│   ├── static/            # All static assets - images, icons, fonts, etc.
├── public/                # Public assets (served as-is)
├── astro.config.mjs       # Astro configuration
├── tailwind.config.js     # Tailwind configuration
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
```

### ⚡️ Why like this?

**Astro.build** is a modern front-end framework that allows you to build faster, optimized websites. It's compatible with React, which is a popular library for building user interfaces.

**Tailwind** -A utility-first approach ensures rapid UI development without writing excessive custom CSS.

## 📈 Performance Best Practices

-   Use **.WEBP format** for images to reduce file size.
-   Optimize assets with tools like [**TinyPNG**](https://tinypng.com/).
-   Self-host fonts instead of using Google Fonts to improve load times.
-   Keep the HTML structure **lightweight** to ensure fast rendering.

## 🎨 Static Media

-   Fonts - setup there you'r all fonts - you don't want to get link to google - this can slow down you'r page, but if you needed, you can delete it and use google tags

-   images - Images are setup with typescript, so this component is easy to use & when you import image there you don't need to worry about use import for every single image

```
  @example
  <Image src="logo" alt="logo" width="50px" height="50px" />
```

You can use your own icons or use Lucide React icons - its up to you

-   icons - Icons are SVG files that you can use in React components, import all you'r icons in static/index.tsx and use it with

```
  @example
  <Icon name="icon" />
```

## 💻 Sitemap - robots - SEO ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️

⚠️ **Search for** ⚠️ **siteUrl** & change website main link to load properly all preview images & ect

also you can check if there is any CHANGEME or YOUR META DESCRIPTION FOR SEO - if yes, then you want to change it

**Sitemap** is generated automatically from astro.config file.

**Astro.config.mjs** There you can find example usage of sitemap, we add comments with if statements for various scenario, so check it & use it as you like!

**Robots** - Also its generated automatically.
